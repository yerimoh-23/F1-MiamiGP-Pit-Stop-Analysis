## Datasets

The Formula 1 data used in this study are obtained from the f1dataR R package that accesses Formula 1 data via the FastF1 Python library. The dataset includes lap-by-lap session data from the 2024 Miami Grand Prix and comprise 1111 laps and 32 variables. These variables include driver details, lap times, pit in/out times, tire information, and track status.

**Source**: R Package 'f1dataR'

-   **Data sources**: Obtain Formula 1 data via the unofficial API <https://www.formula1.com/en/timing/f1-live> via the 'fastf1' 'Python' library <https://docs.fastf1.dev/>.

### Variables

quantitative variable:

-   `lap_time`: recorded time to complete a lap (seconds)

-   `lap_number`: lap number from which the telemetry data was recorded (number of laps)

-   `tyre_life`: number of laps completed on a set of tires (number of laps)

categorical variable:

-   `compound`: type of tire used (SOFT, MEDIUM, HARD)

-   `pit_in`: whether a driver made a pit stop during a lap (binary: 0 = no pit stop, 1 = pit stop occured)

#### Check missing values

![](finalProject_images/missingData)

Data for `lap_time` are missing 5 values which are less than 0.1% of the entire observation
