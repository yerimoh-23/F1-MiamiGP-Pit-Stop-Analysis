## Title
F1 Miami Grand Prix 2024 Pit Stop Analysis

## Abstract
This study employs different regression models to predict when a driver to make a pit stop at during a race, based on the Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix 2024 data. The dataset includes various indicators (32 variables), such as driver details, lap times, pit in/out times, tire information, and track status, for 1111 laps. The aim of this analysis is to estimate pit stop timing based on tire and lap information. The models demonstrate that tire compound, lap number, etc. are significant predictors of pit stop behavior, offering insights into strategic decision-making in race management.
